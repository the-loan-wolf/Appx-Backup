# Appx-Backup
PowerShell script to backup an installed Windows Store App to an installable Appx file.

This small script allows you to make a backup of installed Windows Store apps. This particularly important if you have installed apps that are no longer available from the Winddows Store.

we will try to backup an APP whose file name is "Disney.Wreck-itRalph_1.0.0.12_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt" and live inside this folder "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\"

Example Usage (open a Powershell prompt):
```powershell
PS C:\temp> .\Appx-Backup.ps1 -WSAppPath "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Disney.Wreck-itRalph_1.0.0.12_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt" -WSAppOutputPath "C:\Temp"
Reading "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Disney.Wreck-itRalph_1.0.0.12_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt\AppxManifest.xml"
  App Name : Disney.Wreck-itRalph
  Publisher: CN=58DECE39-D5D0-4293-AAA0-9AF8484F12E2
Creating "C:\Temp\Disney.Wreck-itRalph_1.0.0.12_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt.appx".
  Done.
Creating self-signed certificates.
  Click NONE in the 'Create Private Key Passsword' pop-up.
  Done.
Converting certificate to pfx.
  Done.
Signing the package.
  Done.
Success!
  App Package: "C:\Temp\Disney.Wreck-itRalph_1.0.0.12_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt.appx"
  Certificate: "C:\Temp\Disney.Wreck-itRalph_1.0.0.12_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt.cer"
Install the '.cer' file to [Local Computer\Trusted Root Certification Authorities] before you install the App Package.
PS C:\temp>
```
NOTE: Although this can save the installable program, it cannot save anyuser information such as saved games or other user data. And if the app requires network support from the publisher that is also discontinued, then it's not likely that the reinstalled app will work. YMMV.

Also, this does not sign the app with the publisher's actual key or counter-sign it with the Windows Store key. It signs it with a custom self-signed key. To reinstall your app, you will need first install the *.cer file into your Trusted Root Certificates Store. Just double clicn on the *.cer file and manually add it to the correct store. This requires administrator privileges. Once that is done, you can install the app with the PowerShell command Add-AppxPackage.
